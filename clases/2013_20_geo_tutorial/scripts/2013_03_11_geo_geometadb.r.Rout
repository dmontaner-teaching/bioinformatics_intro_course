Description:

Package:       GEOmetadb
Type:          Package
Title:         A compilation of metadata from NCBI GEO
Version:       1.20.0
Date:          2011-11-28

Description:   The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) represents the
               largest public repository of microarray data. However,
               finding data of interest can be challenging using
               current tools. GEOmetadb is an attempt to make access to
               the metadata associated with samples, platforms, and
               datasets much more feasible. This is accomplished by
               parsing all the NCBI GEO metadata into a SQLite database
               that can be stored and queried locally. GEOmetadb is
               simply a thin wrapper around the SQLite database along
               with associated documentation. Finally, the SQLite
               database is updated regularly as new data is added to
               GEO and can be downloaded at will for the most
               up-to-date metadata. GEOmetadb paper:

3 We investigated the changes in gene expression accompanying the development and progression of kidney cancer using 31,500 element complementary DNA arrays. We measured expression profiles for paired neoplastic and non-cancerous renal epithelium samples from 37 individuals. Using an experimental design optimized for factoring out technological and biological noise, and an adapted statistical test, we find 1738 differentially expressed cDNAs with an expected number of 6 false positives. Functional annotation of these genes provided views of the changes in the activities of specific biological pathways in renal cancer. Cell adhesion, signal transduction, and nucleotide metabolism were among the biological processes with a large proportion of genes overexpressed in renal cell carcinoma. Downregulated pathways in the kidney tumor cells included small molecule transport, ion homeostasis, and oxygen and radical metabolism. Our expression profiling data uncover gene expression changes shared with other epithelial tumors, as well as a unique signature for renal cell carcinoma. Expression data for the differentially expressed cDNAs are available in the web supplement (http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/abt0840/whuber/rcc).;\tKeywords = renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney;\tKeywords: other

At the mRNA level, the expression of some genes changes during the 24-hr period. To identify novel genes regulated in this way, we used microarrays containing 11,521 Arabidopsis expressed sequence tags, representing an estimated 7800 unique genes, to determine gene expression levels at 6-hr intervals throughout the day. Eleven percent of the genes, encompassing genes expressed at both high and low levels, showed a diurnal expression pattern. Approximately 2% cycled with a circadian rhythm. By clustering microarray data from 47 additional, unrelated experiments, we identified groups of genes regulated only by the circadian clock. These groups contained the already characterized clock-associated genes LHY, CCA1, and GI, suggesting that other key circadian clock genes might be found within these clusters.;\tThis research has been described more fully in Schaffer R et al.(2001) Plant Cell 13:113-123;\tKeywords = circadian rhythm;\tKeywords: other

The sperm-enriched group contains an unusually large number of protein kinases and phosphatases. The oocyte-enriched group includes potentially new components of embryonic signaling pathways. The germline-intrinsic group, defined as genes expressed similarly in germlines making only sperm or only oocytes, contains a family of piwi-related genes that may be important for stem cell proliferation. Finally, examination of the chromosomal location of germline transcripts revealed that sperm-enriched and germline-intrinsic genes are nearly absent from the X chromosome, but oocyte-enriched genes are not.;\tThis research has been described more fully in Reinke V et al.(2000) Mol Cell 6:605-16;\tKeywords: other

3 We investigated the changes in gene expression accompanying the development and progression of kidney cancer using 31,500 element complementary DNA arrays. We measured expression profiles for paired neoplastic and non-cancerous renal epithelium samples from 37 individuals. Using an experimental design optimized for factoring out technological and biological noise, and an adapted statistical test, we find 1738 differentially expressed cDNAs with an expected number of 6 false positives. Functional annotation of these genes provided views of the changes in the activities of specific biological pathways in renal cancer. Cell adhesion, signal transduction, and nucleotide metabolism were among the biological processes with a large proportion of genes overexpressed in renal cell carcinoma. Downregulated pathways in the kidney tumor cells included small molecule transport, ion homeostasis, and oxygen and radical metabolism. Our expression profiling data uncover gene expression changes shared with other epithelial tumors, as well as a unique signature for renal cell carcinoma. Expression data for the differentially expressed cDNAs are available in the web supplement (http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/abt0840/whuber/rcc).;\tKeywords = renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney;\tKeywords: other
